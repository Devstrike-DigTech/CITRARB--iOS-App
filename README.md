Coal City Connect (CITRARB)

The project involves the rehabilitation of an existing android and web application known as Coal City Connect.
The applications entails connecting various people within a locale of Enugu State (the coal city) through various attributes like: news, events, chats, music, videos etc.
Some of the features exist and are functional on the existing mobile application while the web application is intended to be a news blog for news updates, engagement and interaction.

The existing software exists on both Google Play Store as an android mobile application and on the internet as a website blog.
The existing mobile app lacks modernization in design, structure , functionality, management and more. When compared against the intended features, the existing software comes below par on its delivery, and does not solve any of the intended problems.
Apart from the front-end, the backend database and code seem to be lacking structure and maintenance. The data stored and fetched are not properly categorized while some other fetched data do not correspond to the intended view/ display.

Below is a simple snapshot of the application under development looks like
